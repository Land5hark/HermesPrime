**Idea Name:** TikTok Trend Wave Catcher

## The Idea (2-3 sentences)

A tool that identifies TikTok trends in their early growth phase—before they peak—allowing creators and brands to ride the wave at optimal timing. Uses data analysis on hashtags, sounds, and engagement velocity to predict which content patterns are about to blow up.

## Why Now? (optional)

TikTok's algorithm favors early adopters of trends. Being first = more reach. Brands pay premium for trend forecasting. Ryan's data/automation skills fit this perfectly.

## Initial Gut Check

- [x] I know someone who would pay for this (brands, creators, agencies)
- [x] This excites me (not just sounds impressive) (AI + social data = dopamine hit)
- [ ] I can finish this in <1 month (maybe? depends on TikTok API access)

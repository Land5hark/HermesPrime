# Idea Capture Template

**Status:** QUEUE (Captured, awaiting research)  
**Date Captured:** 2026-02-16  
**Idea Name:** Genome Intelligence Platform

---

## The Idea (2-3 sentences)

A platform that takes raw DNA data from Ancestry.com/23andMe, runs it through AI-powered analysis pipelines (similar to the YouTube video approach), and generates beautiful, human-readable health reports. Freemium model: free tier gives high-level summaries that tease deeper insights; paid tier unlocks full analysis; premium tier adds AI doctor consultations.

---

## Why Now? (optional)

Millions of people have DNA test results sitting unused. Raw data is technically available but incomprehensible to normal people. AI interpretation has just crossed the threshold where it can explain complex genetics accessibly. Regulatory gray area but not illegal. First-mover advantage in accessible consumer genomics.

---

## Initial Gut Check

- [x] I can build the MVP with current skills (Python backend already working)
- [x] I know someone who would pay for this (health-conscious consumers, biohackers)
- [x] This excites me (AI + health data + helping people understand themselves)
- [ ] I can finish this in <1 month (backend yes, frontend + payments + polish = maybe 6-8 weeks)

## Similar Ideas (if any)

- Promethease (ugly, technical, not user-friendly)
- SelfDecode (subscription model, exists)
- Genetic Genie (free but basic)
- DNAFit (fitness-focused)
- The YouTube video approach (one-off, not productized)

**Key differentiator:** Beautiful reports + freemium hook + AI doctor upsell

## Raw Notes / Brain Dump

**Current State:**
- Python programs working (replicated YouTube video pipeline)
- Can generate technical reports from Ancestry data
- Has his own genome analyzed already

**Product Tiers:**
1. FREE: High-level report, each section teases more detail (lead magnet)
2. PAID: Full interpreted report, all sections explained simply, pretty format
3. PREMIUM: + AI doctor (HN - Human/AI?) consultation, personalized recommendations

**Technical Needs:**
- Frontend (dashboard + report viewer)
- Payment processing (Stripe)
- File upload (DNA raw data files ~10-20MB)
- Automated pipeline (upload → process → generate report)
- PDF/report generation (pretty formatting)
- User accounts + report history
- Upgrade flow (free → paid → premium)

**Go-to-Market:**
- TikTok/YouTube content showing "what I learned from my DNA"
- Reddit communities (r/23andMe, r/AncestryDNA, r/biohacking)
- Partnerships with health influencers
- SEO: "ancestry dna analysis" "understand your genome"

**Risks:**
- FDA regulatory concerns (health claims)
- Data privacy (handling genetic data)
- Liability (misinterpretation of health risks)
- Terms of service (Ancestry/23andMe don't love this)

**MVP Scope:**
- Single DNA provider (Ancestry first)
- 3-5 report categories (health, ancestry, traits, etc.)
- Simple Stripe checkout
- Email delivery of PDF report
- Basic web upload

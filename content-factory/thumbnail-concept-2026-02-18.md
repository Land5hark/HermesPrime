🎨 THUMBNAIL CONCEPT - "I Built a $10K/Month AI Agent"

LAYOUT:
- Background: Split diagonal — electric blue (#0066FF) top-left bleeding into deep black (#0A0A0A) bottom-right
- Main element: Human face split in half — left side natural/human, right side glowing digital circuit pattern overlay (cyberpunk aesthetic), mouth slightly open in "holy sh*t" expression
- Text overlay: "$10K AI AGENT" (top) + "I BUILT THIS" (bottom) — bold condensed sans-serif, white with subtle neon glow
- Color scheme: Electric blue, hot magenta accents, pure white text, deep black negative space

PROMPT FOR IMAGE GEN:
"Hyper-realistic YouTube thumbnail, split face portrait of surprised man, left side normal human face, right side glowing blue digital circuit pattern overlay, cyberpunk aesthetic, electric blue and magenta neon lighting, black background, high contrast, shocked expression with mouth slightly open, dramatic rim lighting, 4K, photorealistic, trending on ArtStation, cinematic composition"

MOCKUP DESCRIPTION:
The thumbnail grabs attention with a "pattern interrupt" — the viewer's brain registers something is "off" about the face before they can process it. The split human/digital face creates curiosity about HOW this transformation happened. The bold "$10K" triggers the money/progress psychology while "AI AGENT" hits the current trend. High contrast ensures it pops in the sidebar. The shocked expression is contagious — viewers feel compelled to understand what caused that reaction.

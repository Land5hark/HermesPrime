## PROLOGUE: THE JEDI AT THE CROSSROADS

There's a particular kind of person who looks at a door—just a regular interior door—and sees not wood and hinges, but geometry. Ratios. Toolpaths. A parametric equation waiting to be solved. Ryan Elliott Clancey is that kind of person.

He's also the kind of person who, in the same breath, will tell you about the AI agent he's training to analyze human genomes, the VPS he's hardening against abuse after a hosting suspension, and the pitch he's rehearsing to convince a gym owner that automated Google review campaigns are the future of small business marketing.

He is, by every measure, a man moving at the speed of thought—and often frustrated that the world can't keep up.

Ryan is 43 years old, born July 31, 1982. A two-time International Chinese Martial Arts Champion turned precision machinist turned AI automation evangelist. A divorcee (technically still legally married, but that's a $450 filing fee away from resolution). A single father. A grandfather at 43—"Jedi" to his granddaughter Aila Jane. A man who discovered at 40 that he's not half-Spanish like he thought his entire life, but 23% Lebanese.

He identifies as AuDHD—both autistic (diagnosed three years ago) and ADHD (diagnosed in 2017). This isn't a footnote in his story; it's the engine that drives everything. The hyperfocus that lets him disappear into a VBA macro for hours until it sings. The executive function challenges that manifest as severe time blindness. The pattern recognition that lets him see automation opportunities where others see only repetitive drudgery. The analysis paralysis that sometimes freezes him at a crossroads when the options multiply faster than he can evaluate them.

As of one week ago, he was fired from Timberland Door after ten months of building automation systems they probably can't even access. He's living with his two aunts (Kathleen and Vicki) in Largo, Florida—a situation that started in July after a breakup, and now he's stuck there jobless with zero income and bills due in two weeks.

His girlfriend Maddy (25) is currently in jail for missing a court date.

He's struggling with addiction to both opiates and methamphetamine—a battle that's been raging for decades.

He can't drive until November.

His storage unit is at risk.

His phone could be shut off.

But he also has a working genome analysis platform.

Twenty unfinished projects at 80-90% completion.

A portfolio of art pieces he's been told are amazing but has never priced.

Thirteen years of manufacturing expertise.

A grandfather's legacy of brilliance and iron will.

This is the story of how the Jedi rises.

## PART I: ORIGINS - THE MAKING OF A CLANCEY

### The Grandfather Who Built Him

Ryan will tell you plainly: 75% of who he is was shaped by his grandfather, **Robert Elliott Clancey**. Born the only son of the youngest daughter, Ryan came into the world in 1982—the same year his grandfather retired. Not to relax. To raise Ryan.

Robert Elliott Clancey was not a man who did things halfway. He served in the Army Air Corps in World War II. He worked for Raytheon, where he was part of the team that designed the Hawks Missile. The federal government then scooped him up to serve as the chief officer of Quality Control at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, D.C.—the place where they make all the paper money.

When he retired in 1982, his pension was $6,000 per month—an astronomical sum then, equivalent to roughly $18,000 per month in today's dollars. He had money. And as a result, Ryan went to private schools his entire life. He was cultured, educated, well-traveled.

Robert Elliott Clancey was also "the highest order of functioning alcoholic," as Ryan would later realize. He bought champagne by the case. Ryan saw him drink every single day but never saw him drunk—except during Lent, when he would quit cold turkey, just to prove he could. When his grandfather's mind was set on something, he did it. No negotiation.

Robert also set the bar impossibly high. He was a goddamn genius with an iron will. Ryan never got in trouble as a child because he never wanted to disappoint him.

Ryan was 16 when his grandfather had an aneurysm. Ryan was the only one home. He called 911. He dealt with it. The central father figure in his life died at the most crucible moment in Ryan's development.

Ryan's grandmother, **Nina M. Clancey**, was "the most wonderful, loving grandmother ever." She loved flowers, had owned a floral shop when she was younger, and had five children: Uncle Barry, Uncle Bobby, Uncle Billy, Aunt Kathleen, and Ryan's mother, **Maureen**. Nina showed love primarily through spending money. She wasn't perfect, but she was present. And between Robert's brilliance and Nina's warmth, Ryan's childhood was shaped by people who expected greatness and provided the resources to achieve it.

### The Family Tree

**Parents:**
- **Maureen** (mother) - married to Peter
- **Peter** (step-father) - "been around since I was young as fuck, like 3 or 5." Ryan describes him as "fucking awesome" and says he "could not have hoped for a better, more loving dad." Peter and Maureen are still married.

**Extended Family:**
- **Aunt Kathleen** - Maureen's sister (Ryan's blood aunt)
- **Aunt Vicki** - Kathleen's wife of many years
- Three uncles (Barry, Bobby, Billy) - all from Nina and Robert

**Children:**
- **Chase Clancey** - Son, born December 10, 2003 (currently 21). Lives with Ryan's parents (Maureen and Peter).
- **Carter Clancey** - Daughter, approximately 18 months older than Chase (currently ~23). Mother of Aila Jane.

**Granddaughter:**
- **Aila Jane** - Carter's daughter, turns 2 on March 15, 2026. Ryan is "Jedi" to her—a name he discovered after learning he's 23% Lebanese and Googling what Lebanese grandparents are called. The Lebanese word for grandpa is spelled J-E-D-I.

**Current Partner:**
- **Maddy** - 25 years old. Together since November 1, 2025 (Halloween night). Currently in jail for missing a court date related to a DUI. Ryan describes himself as "madly in love with this girl."

**Ex-Wife:**
- Lives in Seattle. They haven't spoken in years. Not legally divorced yet—Ryan has been "dragging his feet" on the $450 filing fee.

### Current Living Situation

Ryan is staying with his aunts Kathleen and Vicki in Largo, Florida. He moved in originally in mid-July 2025 after breaking up with a previous girlfriend. He was saving money while working at Timberland Door, then "got dumb and started spending too much." Now he's jobless and about to be completely broke.

He can stay as long as he needs, but "there has to be an end in sight." He doesn't pay rent, but he needs to contribute and can't live there indefinitely.

He cannot drive until November 2026 (license suspension).

## PART II: THE WARRIOR BECOMES AN ADDICT

### The Martial Arts Champion

Ryan started martial arts in second grade with Taekwondo. He continued through high school with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai. In college, he studied traditional Shaolin Kung-Fu—specifically the **Ying Zhao Pi** (Shaolin Eagle Claw) and the **Ni Can Lo Han** (Northern Lost Track System).

He won his weight class in the **International Chinese Martial Arts Championships continuous fighting event** for two years in a row.

He was training for the third tournament when he overtrained. During one-handed pushup drills, he tried to "mind over body" the last couple of reps. His body said no. He tore his labrum, tendons, and ligaments in his right shoulder. Extensive orthopedic surgery was required.

While waiting for surgery, doctors sent him to pain management—a young professional with a family who needed to be able to function. They gave him pharmaceutical-grade heroin. Opiates. OxyContin, likely. Ryan didn't know what they were giving him would kickoff an addiction that has controlled a good portion of his life.

### The Decades of Struggle

Ryan stopped doing opiates several years ago. Around 2016, he started using methamphetamine. As of February 2026, he is currently relapsing and using both opiates and meth.

The substance abuse research he compiled—the 25,000-word treatment guide for Pinellas County inpatient programs—was primarily for Maddy, who needed to go to rehab for court before she got caught up with the warrant that eventually landed her in jail. But it also pertained to himself.

Ryan's plan: when Maddy went to rehab, he would get clean too. He knew she would have zero chance of success if she got out and her partner was using around her. When he still had a job, he wanted to get them a place for her to come home to after a six-month or year-long program.

"I really want to make a life for this girl," he said.

As of now, Maddy is in jail. Ryan is jobless. And he's "not doing so great, but I'm going to keep it moving."

## PART III: EDUCATION & EARLY CAREER

### The Education Path

Ryan graduated high school in 2000, the year he came to Florida. He attended the **University of Tampa**, where he studied entrepreneurship with a concentration in real estate.

After graduating, he worked as a realtor for most of the early 2000s—about seven years total, until the market collapsed in 2008. He saw the crash coming and stepped aside, recouping his investments before the bottom fell out.

He then attended **Pinellas Technical College (P-TECH)** and studied:
- Fiber optic networks
- Low-voltage electronics
- Various certifications in telecommunications

He laid most of the FiOS lines in Pinellas County when fiber optics was still a new technology. Once the lines were laid out, he became "a glorified cable guy," which he couldn't tolerate for long.

He went back to P-TECH again and studied:
- Precision machining
- Manufacturing technology

This is what launched him into the CNC world. He had an aptitude for it right out of the gate and got his first job right out of school working in the computer room at the CNC console. He was fascinated by it all—especially the more complex 3D modeling and CAM programming required for intricate parts.

Thirteen years later, he is an expert in his field.

## PART IV: THE MANUFACTURING YEARS

### The Career Arc

Ryan's manufacturing career reads like a tour of America's precision manufacturing backbone:

**1. Porch Swing Company** (First major role)
- Owner bought a CNC machine but the existing shop lead couldn't make it work
- Ryan answered a Craigslist ad
- Made the CNC "purr like a kitten" and automated the entire manufacturing process
- **Saved the company $250,000 annually** through process automation

**2. CIRCOR Aerospace** (Defense Contractor)
- Programmed CNC systems for U.S. Navy nuclear propulsion projects
- Enhanced precision and efficiency by 28% on mission-critical components
- Worked with 3-, 5-, and 9-axis CNC machines
- Wrote G-code and M-code for titanium, aluminum, and stainless steel
- Tolerances measured in thousandths of an inch—errors compromise submarine safety

**3. Profusion** (Project Estimator & Digital Fabrication Expert)

**4. X-Cell South** (Mold Maker & CAM Programmer)
- Precision injection mold fabrication

**5. EMW Laser** (Additive Manufacturing & Laser Automation Manager)
- **Longest tenure: 2 years**
- Designed and implemented over **200 custom 3D-printed jigs and fixtures**
- Reduced production time by 35%
- Built tool organizers, bit organizers, setting jigs, motion control systems
- Essentially invented the title for himself

**6. Timberland Door** (CAD and CNC Manager)
- April 2025 - February 2026 (~10 months)
- **Terminated one week ago** due to conflict with owner Kevin and burnout/lack of performance
- Built extensive automation systems that are still on their servers
- Plant manager Josh didn't want him to go—knew his value

**Note:** Most positions were contract roles, brought in for specific high-impact projects. EMW Laser at 2 years was his longest tenure.

### Timberland Door: The Automation Cathedral

At Timberland Door, Ryan was responsible for the entire digital fabrication pipeline. His plant manager sent him a daily Excel sheet with a "CAD to do" tab. Every line item was a door. Every door had a part number. His job: find existing files, verify them, organize them, queue them for printing—or create them if they didn't exist.

Ryan systematically, relentlessly automated this.

**The Systems He Built:**

**1. AlphaCam 2025 VBA Macros**
- Custom batch DXF file processing
- Recursive folder scanning
- Auto tool style pin application
- ARD format conversion
- Parametric door design system for the SL3130 style with dimensional tables

**2. CAD File Check Report System**
- Reads daily Excel sheet
- Converts part numbers to internal naming convention
- Scrapes network folders at `\\dgntmhk2\M2M\LICOMDIR\`
- Generates styled HTML reports with metrics:
  - Complete SOs Ready to Print
  - Incomplete SOs Need Work
  - Total Files / Files Found / Overall Complete %

**3. PHP Dashboard**
- Runs on XAMPP at `localhost:8080`
- Connects to n8n workflows via webhook
- Real-time CAD metrics with color-coded KPI cards

**4. Notion Database Integration**
- Tracks workflow runs
- Properties: Run ID, doors count, errors, status, report URLs, timestamps
- Case-sensitive for API mapping compatibility

Ryan fought with n8n's file output nodes for weeks. His solution? Copy-paste into Notepad and save as HTML.

"A man who builds parametric door design automation but saves his reports through Notepad. That's Ryan."

His vision: "I'm still working on the ever important task of automating my job as closely completely as possible. Right now if I can get up to that point automated it will be life changing."

He pitched owner Kevin on attending **FABTECH 2025** with a business case showing projected ROI of $200K-$1M+. When initially positioned as someone the conference would "transform from a CNC programmer into a strategic automation architect," Ryan corrected:

"I'm already way more than a CNC programmer. I'm already building out automation systems and implementing AI. I'm an expert programmer and process engineer (in my mind at least) but yes this would take me to the big next level."

The modesty in the parenthetical. The confidence in the correction. That's Ryan.

## PART V: THE AUTOMATION EVANGELIST

### The Core Philosophy

Ryan does not see automation as convenience. He sees it as **liberation from cognitive tax**.

n8n, APIs, scripts, Docker, Linux, agentic workflows, AI toolchains—these are not toys to him. They are prosthetics for a brain that moves faster than human process allows.

He is not chasing AI hype. He is building second brains, delegated selves, and systems that remember when he cannot.

This matters because Ryan is neurodivergent with severe time blindness. He does not experience time as a smooth gradient. He experiences it as bursts, collapses, and compressions. Without systems, things disappear into the ether. With systems, he becomes unstoppable.

### The Business Ventures

Ryan is not a single business. He is a portfolio of identities:

**AgentiveLabs AI**
- Automation consultancy (attempted launch, unsuccessful)

**Othrworld.ai, LLC**
- Established 2023 (attempted launch, unsuccessful)

The reason they didn't launch successfully: "Analysis paralysis and overwhelmed by so many choices, I was never able to make a clear, concise offer of what it is that I was actually going to productize."

But Ryan has learned: "They don't give a fuck about automation; they care about results. So however I get them to an extra 5 clients a month or save a ton of money, they don't care—they just care that it happens."

**The Creative Brands:**
- **LandShark / LND5HRK** - His moniker for art and design
- **Immortal Style** - Clothing brand concept
- **Civilized Savages** - Another clothing brand
- **NightBreed** - Another brand concept

All have art, business plans, mission statements, marketing hooks, and mythologies. None are generating revenue yet.

### The Problem

"I always have current active projects. That's one of my biggest problems—I can't stop coming up with genius ideas. I'm typical in the sense where I'm a strong starter, but I have a hell of a time crossing that finish line. I've got a number of projects that are 80-90% done."

Off the top of his head:
- Four app ideas
- Two movie scripts
- At least three different brands
- Three different automation clients

His Executive Function Disorder manifests as time blindness most glaringly: "I can't estimate how long something's going to take to save my fucking life. That is no joke."

---

## PART VI: THE ARTIST

### The Multi-Media Creator

Ryan is an artist. Quietly, stubbornly, undeniably.

He started primarily with large sculptures when he won an art grant to build an effigy for a regional Burning Man event. It changed the trajectory of his life.

Wood was always his traditional medium, but he's since expanded into:
- 3D printing (Creality Ender 3 V3, polycarbonate experimentation)
- Laser engraving (K40 CO2 laser, glass engraving, adjustable bed systems)
- CNC 3D carvings designed digitally
- Electronics and micro-controllers
- Interactive art
- Kinetic art
- BDSM furniture and accessories

"I am a multi-media artist through and through. I am as diverse and eclectic as they come."

He obsesses over **finish**, because finish is where truth shows up. Vaporwave aesthetics. Typography. Depth passes. Masking techniques. Black fill perfection. Semi-gloss versus satin debates.

He has a "ton of pieces" ready to sell but struggles with pricing them. "If I didn't have that problem, I have a ton of pieces that I would have put out in various forms by now."

This is the year he rebrands and starts putting his art out there. He's been told he makes amazing art. He just needs to price it and list it.

---

## PART VII: THE GENOME PLATFORM

### The Vision

Ryan got the idea from a YouTuber he follows. He's already built the backend—a Python program that:
- Accepts DNA raw data uploads
- Analyzes it through three different reporting engines
- Spits out three different reports

It works. He uploaded his own DNA and it analyzed it successfully.

**The Next Phase:**
- Have an LLM reinterpret the reports so normal people can understand them
- Aggregate all three into one master report, beautifully formatted
- Build a dashboard that clients can log into
- Add an upsell: unlimited chat with your results and the LLM
- Create a frictionless payment and upload system (Stripe integration)
- Ensure HIPAA compliance or appropriate medical data handling

The actual Python program is done. The analysis works. "It's awesome!"

What's missing:
- Landing page
- Checkout page
- Upload page
- LLM integration (potential issues with medical data)
- Possibility of hosting a model locally on VPS
- Client dashboard
- Interactive chat feature

Ryan estimates this needs 40-80 hours of focused work to reach beta launch status.

---

## PART VIII: THE COMMUNICATOR'S STRUGGLE

### The Bandwidth Problem

Ryan is brilliant at systems thinking, architecture, and design—but articulating these ideas verbally is a challenge.

"I get so excited about automations and everything they're capable of that in my brain so much wants to come out all at once that it bottlenecks and I stumble over my words like an idiot."

This is classic ADHD communication: the ideas aren't the problem. The bandwidth between brain and mouth is the problem.

His solution: preparing scripts, frameworks, layered pitches—the kind of systematic workaround that an engineer's mind would devise for a communications challenge.

### The Pattern

Ryan sees systems where others see tasks. He doesn't just process doors; he builds a pipeline that processes all doors. He doesn't just manage his ADHD; he architects a platform that could manage everyone's ADHD. He doesn't just research treatment programs; he compiles a 25,000-word resource guide. He doesn't just want Google reviews for a gym; he designs a complete sentiment-analysis-powered review ecosystem.

He is a man who has spent his entire career turning raw materials—metal, code, data, ideas—into precision outputs.

The materials have changed over the years. The precision hasn't.

## PART IX: THE CURRENT CRISIS

### The Situation (As of February 11, 2026)

**Employment:** Fired from Timberland Door one week ago

**Income:** Zero. No revenue. No side gigs. Unemployment filing pending.

**Housing:** Living with aunts Kathleen and Vicki (no rent, but can't stay indefinitely)

**Transportation:** Cannot drive until November 2026

**Relationship:** Maddy (25) currently in jail for missing court date

**Addiction:** Currently relapsing on opiates and meth

**Financial Pressure:** Bills due in 2 weeks

**Bills at risk:**
- Cell phone service
- Storage unit (could be auctioned)
- Medications (cannot afford refills)
- Therapy (cannot afford sessions)
- Basic survival needs (food, transportation)

**NOT at risk:**
- Rent (living with aunts)
- Child support (doesn't pay it)

### The Mindset

"I'm so fucking lost right now. I need so much help with all of this. I mean I really need to get a handle on my life. And I need to make some magic happen. And I know I'm capable of magic. My magic is strong. I don't wanna just survive, which obviously I do wanna survive, but I wanna thrive. So I don't wanna just be stuck in survival mode; I wanna be making progress."

Ryan is "super functional and motivated" despite the crisis. He's working at 4:10 AM compiling biographical information for his AI assistants. He's ready to execute.

## EPILOGUE: THE JEDI'S CHOICE

This memoir has three possible endings:

**Ending 1: The Jedi Rises**
- Gets clean, launches genome platform, builds sustainable income, gets Maddy out of jail, builds the life he wants

**Ending 2: The Cycle Continues**
- Gets a job, stabilizes, but never launches anything, stays stuck in the pattern of "almost making it"

**Ending 3: The Crash**
- The addiction wins, the bills pile up, everything falls apart

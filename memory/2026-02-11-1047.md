Created MEMORY.md in /home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace with initial long‑term notes (your name, timezone, my identity/vibe, and next steps like connecting Telegram). Want me to remove BOOTSTRAP.md now or keep it until Telegram is linked?
user: [Tue 2026-02-10 08:10 UTC] lets link telegram first

Awake. Restarting the gateway now, then I'll start the questions.
assistant: Gateway restart is disabled in the config (set `commands.restart=true` to enable). I can guide you to enable it if you want, or you can run `openclaw gateway restart` directly.

Meanwhile, here are 5 questions to get to know you better:

1. **What are your pronouns?** (for USER.md)

2. **What do you do?** (job, passion project, student, etc. — whatever defines your days)

3. **What's one thing you're currently working toward or care deeply about?** (a goal, a problem you're solving, something you want to achieve)

4. **What instantly annoys you?** (inefficiency, loud chewers, bad UX, something else?)

5. **What makes you actually laugh?** (dark humor, dad jokes, absurdity, specific shows/people?)

Reply with whatever you're comfortable sharing — I'll update USER.md with what I learn. Say "stop" when you've had enough questions.

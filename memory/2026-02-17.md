## OpenClaw Configuration Updates
- Added OpenRouter provider with API key (sk-or-v1-a9ea...)
- Configured cost-effective subagent models:
  - Primary: GPT-4o Mini (alias: Mini)
  - Fallback: Claude 3.5 Haiku (alias: Haiku)
- Gateway restarted successfully to apply changes
- Doctor fix applied to resolve config validation issue

## Research Findings: ChatGPT Plus & Claude Pro
**Key Finding:** Neither subscription includes API access
- ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo) = Web UI only
- Claude Pro ($20/mo) = Web UI + Claude Code only
- Both require separate API billing to power OpenClaw
- Unofficial workarounds exist but violate ToS

## User Preferences
- Wants perplexity/sonar-deep-research for deep research tasks
- Prefers cost-effective models for routine subagent work
- OpenRouter credits available for API calls

## Technical Notes
- Subagent model config simplified (removed invalid fallbackModel key)
- Doctor command successfully validated and repaired config
- All channels (Telegram, WhatsApp) connected and functional

## YouTube Transcript Extraction Attempt
**Video:** "Use OpenClaw with your Claude subscription" by The Next New Thing
**Video ID:** I7KFOhjmM1M
**Issue:** YouTube blocked automated transcript extraction (cloud provider IP ban)
**Workaround:** User needs to manually extract via YouTube's "Show transcript" feature or use browser extension
**Relevance:** Video directly addresses using Claude Pro with OpenClaw - potential solution to earlier research question

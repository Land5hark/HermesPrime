[Thu 2026-02-12 07:10 UTC] what are nodes in the context of openclaw
[message_id: db69e3a3-b780-4d49-ba2e-9ce43268d1be]
assistant: In OpenClaw, **nodes** are remote devices you control—phones, laptops, other computers—that pair with your main OpenClaw instance.

**What nodes can do:**
- Run commands remotely (`nodes run`)
- Access cameras (`nodes camera_snap`)
- Record screens (`nodes screen_record`)
- Get GPS location (`nodes location_get`)
- Execute code or scripts on the remote device

**How it works:**
1. Install OpenClaw on the remote device (or just the node client)
2. Pair it using `openclaw node pair`
3. Once connected, you can issue commands from your main session to control that device

**Example use cases:**
- Snap a photo from your phone's camera remotely
- Record your desktop screen while you're away
- Run a script on your home computer from your phone
- Get your phone's current GPS location

Your config has a `nodes.denyCommands` section that blocks certain sensitive commands (camera, screen recording, calendar/contacts access) by default for security.

Want to pair a new device or check what nodes you have connected?

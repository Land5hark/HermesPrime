# 2026-02-13 — Session Log

## Perplexity SDK Setup
- Installed `perplexity-sdk` via npm (local to workspace)
- API key stored in:
  - `TOOLS.md` (reference)
  - `~/.bashrc` (as `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` env var)
- Test script created at `test-perplexity.js` — verified working with `sonar` model
- SDK location: `/home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace/node_modules/perplexity-sdk/`

## Workspace Changes
- Created `/docs` folder for future web search caching
- SDK installation added 34 packages to workspace

## Notes
- SDK usage pattern: `new Perplexity({ apiKey }).client()` then `chatCompletionsPost()`
- Model tested: `sonar` (working)
- Future searches should cache results to `/docs/web-search/` as per user request

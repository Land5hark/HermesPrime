Example: *"What's the best skill for handling database migrations?"*

### To Check What's Available:
> "Check the skills registry" or "What skills do we have for [topic]?"

### For Complex Work:
> "Spawn a sub-agent with [skill] to [task]"

Example: *"Spawn a sub-agent with docker-essentials to optimize the Dockerfile"*

## 🎯 Quick Decision Tree

```
Building something new?
├── Database layer needed? → "Use prisma"
├── API/backend? → "Use fastapi" or "Use nodejs-patterns"
├── Frontend UI? → "Use react" or "Use nextjs-expert"
├── Docker/deployment? → "Use docker-essentials"
└── Testing? → "Use testing-patterns"

Stuck/procrastinating?
├── Can't start? → "Body double me"
├── Overwhelmed? → "Help me plan today"
├── Too many projects? → "Use project-management-guru-adhd"
└── Analysis paralysis? → "Break this down into micro-steps"

Debugging?
├── Docker issues? → "Use docker-diag"
├── Container crashes? → "Use container-debug"
├── Test failures? → "Use testing-patterns"
└── General debugging? → Describe the error, I'll pick the skill
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Say

❌ "Load all the skills" (causes bloat)
❌ "Use every skill you have" (inefficient)
❌ Vague: "Fix this" without context (I'll ask for more anyway)

✅ DO: Be specific about the domain (database, frontend, Docker, etc.)
